Give yourself the style of a comic book. Dot size and shadow intensity completely customizable. [This one DOES require this Comic Book Dot.tga file](https://github.com/Aerthas/Aerthas-Unity-Shaders/blob/master/Misc/Comic%20Dot.tga)<br/><br/>
*Shader will utilize the world lighting if there is a world light, or will switch to its own internal shading automatically if there isn't one.*

### [Runescape Shader](https://github.com/Aerthas/Aerthas-Unity-Shaders/blob/master/Misc/Runescape.shader)

Nice dinky shader to emulate the look of Runescape. Dithered shadows to make it look closer to the game, and the verticies will round the location to the nearest world position to give it that jittering look.<br/><br/>
