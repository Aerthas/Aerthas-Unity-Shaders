 Bunch of the shaders I make for Unity

Emulates the look of the FABULOUS Arc System Works games.<br/><br/>
*Shader will utilize the world lighting if there is a world light, or will switch to its own internal shading automatically if there isn't one.*

## Comic Book Shader

Give yourself the style of a comic book. Dot size and shadow intensity completely customizable.<br/><br/>

Nice dinky shader to emulate the look of Runescape. Dithered shadows to make it look closer to the game, and the verticies will round the location to the nearest world position to give it that jittering look.<br/><br/>
